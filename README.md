My slow, laborious trawl through
[the second edition of the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)

The master branch sticks closely to the book's contents.
Other branches contain side notes and related projects,
such as the suggessted programs at the end of Chapter 3.

Tags correspond to the end of the corresponding chapter or section.
